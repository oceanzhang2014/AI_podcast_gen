# Form Data Persistence with Default Admin User

## ADDED Requirements

### FDP-01: Admin User System
The system SHALL provide a default admin user for data association when no login system exists.

#### Scenario: Admin user initialization
- GIVEN the application starts up
- WHEN the system initializes
- THEN the system SHALL automatically create or retrieve a default "admin" user for data association

#### Scenario: Admin user identification
- GIVEN form data needs to be associated with a user
- WHEN no login system is present
- THEN the system SHALL use the admin user ID for all data operations

### FDP-02: Podcast Configuration Persistence
The system SHALL persist podcast generation form data to the database for later retrieval.

#### Scenario: Form data saving
- GIVEN a user fills out the podcast generation form with topic, participants, rounds, and character configurations
- WHEN the user generates a podcast or explicitly saves the configuration
- THEN the system SHALL store all form data in the database associated with the admin user

#### Scenario: Configuration validation
- GIVEN form data is being saved to the database
- WHEN the data contains invalid or missing required fields
- THEN the system SHALL reject the save operation and return validation errors

### FDP-03: Configuration Retrieval
The system SHALL retrieve and provide the most recently saved podcast configuration.

#### Scenario: Page loads with saved configuration
- GIVEN the admin user has previously saved podcast configurations
- WHEN the user loads the main page
- THEN the system SHALL automatically retrieve and populate the form with the latest saved configuration

#### Scenario: No saved configuration exists
- GIVEN the admin user has never saved a podcast configuration
- WHEN the user loads the main page
- THEN the system SHALL display the form with default values and no saved data indicators

### FDP-04: User-Based Audio File Naming
The system SHALL generate audio files with user-specific naming conventions.

#### Scenario: Admin user audio generation
- GIVEN the admin user generates a podcast
- WHEN the audio file is created
- THEN the system SHALL name the file using the format `admin_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.wav`

#### Scenario: Timestamp format consistency
- GIVEN multiple audio files are generated
- WHEN creating filenames
- THEN the system SHALL use consistent timestamp format `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` for chronological sorting

### FDP-05: Session-Based User Tracking
The system SHALL track user sessions for data association.

#### Scenario: Session creation
- GIVEN a user accesses the application
- WHEN no existing session is found
- THEN the system SHALL create a new session associated with the admin user

#### Scenario: Session persistence
- GIVEN a user session exists
- WHEN the user interacts with the application
- THEN the system SHALL maintain session continuity across page requests

## MODIFIED Requirements

### FDP-06: Form Data Structure
The system SHALL define a comprehensive structure for podcast configuration data.

#### Scenario: Complete configuration storage
- GIVEN a podcast generation form
- WHEN saving the configuration
- THEN the system SHALL store:
  - Topic text
  - Number of participants
  - Conversation rounds
  - AI provider and model settings
  - All character configurations (name, gender, background, personality, age, style)
  - Form metadata (created/updated timestamps)

#### Scenario: Character configuration handling
- GIVEN multiple character configurations
- WHEN saving to database
- THEN the system SHALL store each character as a separate structured record

### FDP-07: Audio File Detection and Loading
The system SHALL update audio file detection to work with user-specific naming.

#### Scenario: User-specific audio detection
- GIVEN the admin user loads the main page
- WHEN searching for the latest audio
- THEN the system SHALL filter files by admin user prefix and select the most recent

#### Scenario: Backward compatibility
- GIVEN existing audio files without user prefixes exist
- WHEN the system scans for audio files
- THEN the system SHALL handle both old and new naming formats gracefully

### FDP-08: URL Generation and Routing
The system SHALL update audio URL generation for user-specific files.

#### Scenario: Audio URL creation
- GIVEN a user-specific audio file exists
- WHEN generating audio URLs
- THEN the system SHALL use the correct user-prefixed filename in URLs

#### Scenario: Download URL generation
- GIVEN a user requests audio download
- WHEN generating download URLs
- THEN the system SHALL provide the correct user-specific file path

### FDP-09: User Management Integration
The system SHALL integrate with existing user management infrastructure.

#### Scenario: Database user handling
- GIVEN the existing users table structure
- WHEN implementing admin user functionality
- THEN the system SHALL extend existing user management rather than replace it

#### Scenario: Configuration service integration
- GIVEN the existing configuration service
- WHEN adding admin user functionality
- THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing configuration patterns

## REMOVED Requirements

### FDP-10: Generic Audio Naming
The system SHALL remove generic timestamp-only naming in favor of user-specific naming.

#### Scenario: Legacy naming phase-out
- GIVEN the new naming system is implemented
- WHEN generating new audio files
- THEN the system SHALL no longer use generic `podcast_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.wav` format

## Implementation Notes

### Database Schema Extensions
- Add `podcast_configs` table with columns: id, user_id, topic, participants, rounds, ai_provider, ai_model, character_configs (JSON), created_at, updated_at
- Extend existing user management for admin user support
- Add foreign key relationships to users table

### Admin User Creation
- Check for existing admin user on application startup
- Create admin user if not exists with default properties
- Use consistent admin user identification across the system

### File Detection Algorithm
1. Scan audio directory for files matching `{username}_*.wav` pattern
2. If no user files found, fall back to legacy `podcast_*.wav` files
3. Sort files by modification time
4. Select the most recent file
