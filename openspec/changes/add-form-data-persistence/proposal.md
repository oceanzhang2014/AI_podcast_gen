# Add Form Data Persistence with Default Admin User

## Overview

This proposal adds data persistence functionality to store and restore podcast generation form data using a default admin user. The system will automatically save all form information (topic, participants, conversation rounds, AI model configuration, character configurations) and improve audio file naming conventions.

## Why

The current application lacks data persistence which creates several user experience problems:
1. **Lost Data**: Users lose all form data when refreshing the page
2. **Repetitive Entry**: Users must re-enter complex character configurations and settings repeatedly
3. **No Configuration History**: No way to review or reuse previous podcast generation settings
4. **Generic File Organization**: Audio files use generic naming making it difficult to organize user content

By implementing data persistence with a default admin user system, we can:
- **Improve User Experience**: Automatically save and restore form configurations
- **Enable Future Multi-User Support**: Lay groundwork for future login system implementation
- **Better File Organization**: Implement user-specific audio file naming
- **Configuration Reusability**: Allow users to modify and regenerate similar podcasts

This change provides immediate value while being architecturally sound for future expansion.

## Problem Statement

Currently, the application lacks data persistence for form configurations:
- Form data is lost when the page is refreshed
- No way to save and restore podcast generation settings
- Audio files use generic naming without user identification
- No history of previously used configurations

## Proposed Solution

Implement a comprehensive data persistence system with:
1. **Default Admin User System**: Use "admin" as the default user when no login system exists
2. **Form Data Storage**: Save all podcast generation form fields to database
3. **Auto-Restore Functionality**: Automatically load admin user's last saved configuration on page load
4. **Improved Audio Naming**: Use `username_timestamp` format for audio files
5. **User Session Management**: Track admin user sessions and preferences

## Architectural Changes

### Database Schema Extensions
- Add `podcast_configs` table for storing form data
- Add `user_sessions` table for session management
- Extend existing tables to support user-specific audio file organization

### Backend Changes
- Extend `ConfigRepository` to handle podcast form data
- Add `PodcastConfigRepository` for form data persistence
- Modify audio file generation to use user-specific naming
- Update index route to load saved form data

### Frontend Changes
- Add JavaScript to auto-save form data
- Implement form restoration on page load
- Update UI to indicate when data is saved/restored

## Benefits

- **Improved User Experience**: No need to re-enter form data
- **Data Persistence**: Configurations survive page refreshes
- **Better Organization**: User-specific audio file naming
- **Future-Proof**: Foundation for future multi-user support

## Implementation Scope

This change focuses on minimal, straightforward implementation:
1. Database schema updates
2. Repository layer extensions
3. Form data save/restore functionality
4. Audio file naming improvements
5. Basic admin user session handling

## Breaking Changes

- Database schema requires migration
- Audio file naming convention changes
- New dependencies on session management

## Dependencies

- Existing SQLite database infrastructure
- Current configuration management system
- Session management (browser-based)

## Success Criteria

- Form data is automatically saved when podcast is generated
- Page refresh restores previous form configuration
- Audio files use `admin_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.mp3` naming
- Latest admin audio is automatically loaded on homepage
- No impact on existing podcast generation functionality
