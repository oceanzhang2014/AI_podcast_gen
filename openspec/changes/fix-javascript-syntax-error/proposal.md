## Why
JavaScript syntax error in main.js prevents the character configuration form from displaying, breaking the podcast generation interface functionality.

## What Changes
- Fix syntax error in `updateStyleOptions` function at line 656 (extra closing brace)
- Correct indentation and structure of event handler code
- Ensure proper function closure and bracket matching
- Validate JavaScript syntax throughout the affected functions

## Impact
- Affected specs: frontend (character configuration, dynamic voice options)
- Affected code: `static/js/main.js` - specifically the `updateStyleOptions` function
- Restores ability to select character voice styles and generate podcasts
