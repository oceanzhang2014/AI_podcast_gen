## Why
The AI Podcast Generator application requires a specific Python 3.12.11 environment with complex dependencies including PyTorch, ChatTTS, and FFmpeg integration. Current setup may fail due to missing dependencies, version conflicts, or environment configuration issues.

## What Changes
- Create Python 3.12.11 virtual environment setup process
- Install and configure all required dependencies from requirements.txt
- Resolve common runtime errors related to PyTorch, ChatTTS, and FFmpeg
- Test application startup and basic functionality
- Document environment setup for reproducible deployment

## Impact
- Affected specs: environment-setup (new capability)
- Affected code: app.py, requirements.txt, and all dependent modules
- Prerequisites for running the AI Podcast Generator application
- Ensures reproducible development and deployment environment
