## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: PyDub-based Audio Merging
The system SHALL use PyDuB AudioSegment for combining individual character audio segments into a single podcast file.

#### Scenario: Merge sequential audio segments
- **WHEN** individual character audio files are generated from dialogue
- **THEN** the system loads each audio file as AudioSegment and concatenates them in chronological order
- **AND** produces a single combined audio file for the complete podcast

#### Scenario: Clean up temporary audio files
- **WHEN** audio merging is completed successfully
- **THEN** the system removes all individual character audio files
- **AND** retains only the final combined podcast audio file

### Requirement: Audio File Management
The system SHALL manage audio files with timestamp naming and organized directory structure.

#### Scenario: Generate timestamped output
- **WHEN** a podcast is generated
- **THEN** the final audio file is named with timestamp format `podcast_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.wav`
- **AND** the file is saved to the configured audio output directory

#### Scenario: Handle audio processing errors
- **WHEN** PyDub audio loading or merging fails
- **THEN** the system logs the error and attempts to continue with remaining audio segments
- **AND** provides detailed error information for debugging

### Requirement: Audio Format Consistency
The system SHALL ensure all audio segments use compatible formats for seamless merging.

#### Scenario: Standardize audio format
- **WHEN** different TTS engines produce audio (ChatTTS, gTTS, pyttsx3)
- **THEN** the system converts all segments to consistent WAV format before merging
- **AND** maintains audio quality across format conversions
